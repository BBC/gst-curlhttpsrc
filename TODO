==== A list of currently outstanding, known issues and nice-to-have things ====
===============================================================================

 This is a list of things to do in the curlhttpsrc gstreamer plugin. Here all
 known bugs will be listed and their current status. Alongside these, there
 are list of Time-Allocated and Nice-to-Have features and improvements that
 have been suggested or are known to the developer(s). Time-Allocated means
 that there is a plan by the developers to work on them at some point, whereas
 the Nice-to-have list is full of things that would be great to include, but
 at the moment they can't be justified.

 Bugs are always worth squashing.

 If you feel like you want to attempt anything on this list, feel free to send
 a patch or submit a pull request on our github project!

| #    | Name and Short Description                                  | STATUS |
===============================================================================
| 1    | Known Bugs                                                           |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================
| 2    | New Features (Time-Allocated)                                        |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 2.1  | Allow for Chunked delivery of requests                      | OPEN   |
|      |                                                             | [#279] |
|      |   Return the received message as each chunk is read with    |        |
|      |   gst_curl_http_src_get_chunks instead of handing it back   |        |
|      |   as one large buffer.                                      |        |
===============================================================================
| 3    | Feature Improvements (Time-Allocated)                                |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 3.1  | Improve GstTask usage to fit with the GLib/GStreamer style  | OPEN   |
|      |                                                             | [#278] |
|      |   Currently, the curl worker task is operating like a       |        |
|      |   pthread, not like a GstTask. This should be changed, so   |        |
|      |   as to operate as a looping function and losing the while  |        |
|      |   loop currently acheiving this task.                       |        |
===============================================================================

| 5    | Feature Improvements (Nice-to-have)                                  |
